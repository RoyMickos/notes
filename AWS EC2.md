AWS EC2 are physical/virtual servers on the net. It is based on server virtualization, by default you get a virtualized server, however, a whole physical machine can also be reserved for you should you need one for security or licencing reasons. Security you get by not having any other workloads on the same server, while some licensing is tied to physical hardware. Even if you reserve a physical server, you can run virualized workloads on it.
Physical server is the most expensive option of the lot. A virualized server can be easily scaled so you get many different types and price points. There are also two architectures (arm / x86) on offer, plus special GPU-powered servers as well.
Of the other options, On-Demand is the standard and next pricey option on the list. This is because you can start/stop this server at will, and a stopped server does not incur and (EC2) costs. If you know that you will run your server for a long time, you can get significant savings by using reserved instances, where you commit to 1-3 years of running your server. You will pay this irrespective of whether your server is running or not., this is known as the EC2 savings plan. Related to this, there is a Compute savings plan, where you commit to a certain $/per hour spend, which you can then use on EC2, Fargate, and serverless. This offers less discount (66% vs 72% max) but offers more flexibility if you need to scale horizontally or decide to move workloads to containers.
Finally, you can purchase unused capacity using _spot_ instances. These are good for batch jobs that are not time critical. You can set a spot price, then wait until spot price drops below to have your workload running.
