This recipe uses date paste as a sweetener. The easiest way is to go with the store-bought date paste, but you can make your own date paste in just 5 minutes.

Simply fill the glass jar with the dried pitted dates (the cheap ones), cover with hot water, put the lid on and let it sit for 1 hour.

OATMEAL ENERGY BALLS RECIPE
Ingredients:
3 cups quick cooking oats (270g)
1/2 cup peanut butter (125g)
1/2 cup ground flax seed (75g)
1 cup date paste (250g)
1/3 cup coconut oil (70g)
mix-ins (dark chocolate, dried cranberries, chopped walnuts, chia seeds)

Preparation:
In a bowl add the oats, peanut butter, flax meal, date paste and coconut oil. Using your hands mix all the ingredients together. If you prefer you can do it with the food processor too.
If the mixture is too dry to shape (which depends on the consistency of the date paste), add some water.
Add the mix-ins and give it a final mix.
Scoop about 1 tablespoons of mixture and using your hands form the bite sized balls.
You can eat them immediately.

Freeze or store in the fridge for up to 3 months.
