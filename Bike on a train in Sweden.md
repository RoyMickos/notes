Unlike most civilized countries, sweden does not allow bikes on long-distance trains. You can have your bike in a box, or have a folding bike, but no ordinary bike spots are available. There are two options for transferring your bike, assuming you want to go to Denmark where bike civilization is restored:
1. Some flixbus have bike spots on the Stockholm-Malmö line. In Malmö you can take Öresundståg to Denmark, and they have bike spots.
2. Use local trains to transport your bike.

Here's one possible itinerary using local trains:
1. [Mälartåget](https://www.malardalstrafik.se/) From Stockholm C to Linköping with a transfer in Katrineholm. These two legs can be covered with one ticket, so that's why these are combined.
2. [Östgötapendeln](https://www.ostgotatrafiken.se/) from Linköping to Tranås via transfer in Mjölby. Again, tickets can be brought from one spot to both legs.
3. [Krösatåg](https://www.jlt.se/) this company takes you from Tranås to Alvesta again with a change in Nässjö. You have to by the tickets from one of the participating regional transport companies.
4. Finally in Alvesta you can hop onto [Öresundståget](https://www.oresundstag.se/) a train taking you all the way to Copenhagen.

Most of these trains have this bike policy: bikes are carried for free, but since there are limited places you cannot be guaranteed with a bike spot and the train personnel can deny a trip on that basis. Also, if the bike space is shared with baby trolleys the trolleys have priority.

Interrail can be used on all connections except for Östgötatrafiken (Linköping-Tranås). If you want to avoid this connection, you can take a detour by instead going from Liköping to Kalmar [Kalmar länstrafik](https://kalmarlanstrafik.se/) and in Kalmar you can again take östersundståg to Copenhagen.  BUT unfortunately this line does NOT allow for bikes. Although this is a detour on the map, it does not cost you travel time that much, and avoids two changes. Plus, on both legs around Kalmar you hop on the start station of the train which increases you chances of getting a bike spot. If you take the Turku ferry, you'd be in Copenhagen before 18:00.
