Magic keywords in the search bar:
- using a minus sign before a term searches for hits that do NOT contain that term
- use `filetype:` to limit results to certain file types (pdf, ppt etc)
- "quoting a set of words" searches for the exact phrase instead of just individual words
- using attribure `site:` limits the results to that site.
