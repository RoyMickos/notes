Considering this. Key issue is the design for layers, which needs more investigation. Don't want to end up in a situation where you need to type a character and you cannot find it on your keyboard. So, how to type accents etc, in addition to the usual suspects. Needs to be compact and small, therefore corne with 42 keys seems suitable.
