There's even a [spec](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit formats that specifies how commit messages are to be written to detect breaking changes etc. It is formal to allow for automatic processing of the messages.
There is tooling to check the commit format: [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional).
