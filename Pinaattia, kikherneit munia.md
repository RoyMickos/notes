### **Ingredients**
- 6 tbsp extra virgin olive oil 90 ml
- 1 small onion
- 4 cloves garlic
- 1 tsp sweet smoked Spanish paprika 2.50 grams
- 1/2 tsp ground cumin 1 gram
- 4 tomatoes
- 15.5 oz can chickpeas 440 grams
- 10 oz fresh bagged spinach 300 grams
- 1/4 cup vegetable broth 60 ml
- 2 eggs
- pinch sea salt
- dash black pepper
### **Instructions**
1. Heat a large fry pan with a medium heat and add in 2 tbsp (30 ml) extra virgin olive oil
2. After a couple minutes add in the onion finely diced and the garlic roughly chopped, mix with the olive oil, after 3 to 4 minutes and the onion is translucent, add in the paprika and cumin, quickly mix together, then add in the 4 tomatoes finely grated, the canned chickpeas (drained and rinsed) and season with sea salt and black pepper, mix together and then simmer
3. Once the grated tomato has slightly thickened up, about 5 to 7 minutes, add in the spinach roughly chopped, I like to add it in there in batches and mix, to not overcrowd the pan
4. Once all the spinach has been added and mixed in, add in the vegetable broth and lower to a low heat
5. Meanwhile, heat a small fry pan with a medium heat and add in 4 tbsp (60 ml) extra virgin olive oil, once the oil is hot fry eggs, making sure to keep the egg yolk creamy, once cooked, season the eggs with sea salt & black pepper
6. After simmering the spinach mixture for 5 to 7 minutes, remove from the heat
7. Transfer the spinach mixture into shallow bowls, then top off each one with a fried egg, then again with a little spinach mixture, making sure to leave the egg yolk exposed, enjoy!
