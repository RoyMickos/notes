You can allocate permissions using policies, which can be identity-based or resource-based. An identity-based policy is attached to a role, group, or user, defining what the identity can do to which resources. There are a number of AWS managed policies that can be used for identity-based policies.
Alternatively, you can allocate the policy on an individual resource. These are called resource-based policies and are always inline policies, i.e. there are no AWS managed policies for this purpose.
Since an account only sees users allocated to it, identity-managed policies can only be set to the identities of that account. Therefore, if you want to allow access to an user from another account, then the resource-based policy is your only option. In these cases, you always need to create the policy manually.
