# How to review code

Compilers and linters are best for checking syntax issues. If a review lands on your table it most probably
has passed a ci pipeline with tests etc. It is best to focus on the bigger picture. That said, you should
still understand the code as it might end up to be maintained by you.

Also, it is likely that AI will evolve to be able to spot common pitfalls in the code.

Focus on things like
- does the code accomplish what was requested by the user story?
- are the code conventions in line with the rest of the code?
- are the test adequate ?
- does the code replicate previously written code ?
- does the code agree with policies agreed upon by the team ?
- are there known design patterns for the problem solved by the code?
