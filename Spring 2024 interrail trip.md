In this trip I wanted to extend my winter holiday with some workation done while traveling.  I did not plan all my travel days to be for working because I was not sure if it is possible. Also, I wanted to take my Brompton for a ride.
So I combined my winter vacation with easter holiday and set my target to Lisbon where we had an office. Before this I had plans for a bike holiday in Girona, but that turned out to be complicated in initial planning. Maybe later.
I started out by trying to include night train routes to my journey, but this turned out to be very difficult. I originally intended to travel during day to Hamburg to catch a night train to Basel, but given the poor train punctuality in Germany, I could not create connections with enough transfer time. Finally it also turned out that it was very difficult to reserve beds for the night jet. The explanations were that they had not gotten confirmations about their route so the had not made beds available. Also, it appears that the interrail quota on nightjets is limited. This combined with the fact that the timetables between companies and interrail are syncronized maybe monthly made planning for it  a frustrating experience, and it got dropped. The only night trains on my journey ended up being with SJ.
Brompton was used for the first time fo ride from the ferry terminal to the centralstationet, which worked out without any issues. I still had my old phone with a phone mount attachned, so I used it with offline maps to navigate.
As the daytime connection to Hamburg turned out to be problematic, I resorted to using the Euronight from Stockholm to Hamburg. This, together with a connection from Frankfurt to Marseille solved my scheduling issues all the way to the end of France.
This worked out at the end, but not without hiccups and stresses: when we started from Stockholm central we got all the way to Flemmingsberg (stockholm suburb) where the trains stopped and it was announced that there is an elecrification failure on the tracks. This turned into around 2,5 hours of delay, which eated up my schedule buffer in Germany. Needless to say I did not sleep wery well when pondering whether my plan failed in the first possible train voyage. In the end my planning payed out: I caught the last possible connection to Frankfurt, and thank god that was not delayed, so I reached Frankfurt with some 45 minutest to spare. However, the hiccups did not end there. Two days before my trip was about to start, SJ informed me that the train will not go to Hamburg HBF, intread it will go to Hamburg-Harburg. Luckily my connections also stopped there. However, I had reserved a seat on a train with 1h 30min connection time on an ICE, which mysteriously vanished from timetables. I had to call DB plone line who informed me that my train is still running, it just leaves one hour earlier that was shown on my ticked. They had not bothered to inform me about this change. In any case, I would have missed that one.

Then, a Renfe connection from Marseille to Madrid seemed promising. But the Renfe interrail seat reservation horror story had me make a plan b using the local trains connection from Marseille to Barcelona, where the Barcelone-Madrid connection seats could be reserved from the internet. The horror story is that renfe international trains cannot make seat reservations through the net. You cannot even book a seat in Marseille, only in spanish railway stations! I had read on the net that it would be possible to buy the seat reservation from the train, so this connection was left open.
It turned out that you could not get to the train without a valid ticked. SNCF had put some guards at the gate, and when I tried to ask could I buy a ticket from the train they just said that tickets are not their problem, they are just helping out with the gate. So plan B it was. In hindsight, it would have been a good move to book this ticked from Renfe and buy an intrerrail ticket with fewer days instead. Plan B woked, I just got a little later to Madrid. Also In Madird bromton was used to get to the hotel in the same way as in stockholm, ok.

The renfe horrro story extended to the final leg from Madird to Lisbon. No seats could be reserved from Madrid to Badajoz, and no schedule information about the trains were given at the beginning of the year. In the end I found a Flixbus connection at the same price that my seat reservation would have costed, so I used flixbus both ways.
Flixbus worked out ok, it was like Onnibus but for 8-9 hours in a row. On the way back the bus toilet did not have running water, and the overhead shelf did not accommodate my backpack. Would only use is no better option in the future.
