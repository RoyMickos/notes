Scan operations are used when the whole table needs to be searched. This is quite expensive and clumsy as well: scan operations have a 1 MB size limit, which leads to pagination if the result set exceeds this. Furthermore, any filtering operation is done _after_ the scan, any limits are applied before the filter, so you never avoid handling all elements.
Therefore the composite key structure of partition key and sort key is important, as DynamoDB stores sort key values close to each other so that the query cost can be limited. Stuff under the partition key alone is called an item collection, and this can be queried the same way as scanning: 1 MB size limit, pagination, filters are applied after the base query and will reduce the result thus always hitting the entire soft key collection.
