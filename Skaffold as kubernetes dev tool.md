[Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/) is a tool that helps in kube development. It detects dependencies and when source code is modified, it builds and deploys affected containers to minikube. It uses configuration similar to kubernetes and is able to work on kubernetes configurations. It uses Image Builders, Testers, Deployers, Tag Policies and Push strategies. Here dealing with builders and deployers.

In container context the obvious build tool is docker (bazel can also handle docker). For deployment, kubectl, kustomize or helm can be used. Previously we used the former two, but apparently helm would be better option as the configurations could be shared between dev and production.

Skaffold employs a hierarchical struvture where you can split the configuration in such a way that each unit (like postgres, service etc) has it's own skaffold.yml file. You then include these atomic files to form bigger units (or collections). One pattern is to also split the build parts to their own configurations, whereby you define the containers to be built in separate files and name them. You then write separate skaffold files for deployment referring tot he images by these names.
