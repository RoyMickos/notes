Wash and soak the brown lentils for at least 4 to 6 hours (or overnight) until the lentils are very tender.
[PLEASE NOTE: The soaking time depends on the quality of the lentils. Some brown lentils are more dry than the others and will there need more soaking time.
How to know if the lentils are soaked well? You could should be able to cut a lentil piece with your nails, effortlessly. If not, then soak it longer]

Thoroughly wash the rice until the water runs clear, this will get rid of any impurities and gunk (this is an important step so please do not skip it). Soak it for about 20 minutes.

Heat a pan, add the cooking oil, onion and 1/2 tsp salt. Adding salt to the onions will help release water and help it cook faster. Fry the onion on medium-high heat until it starts to caramelize. At this point, reduce the heat to medium to medium-low heat (depending on the heat of your stove) and add the finely chopped ginger and garlic. Fry everything until the onions are nicely browned (be careful not to burn the onion).

Once the onions are nicely caramelized, add the strained tomatoes/passata and the spices and give it a nice mix. Now drain and rinse the lentils/drain the rice. Add it to the pot along with the salt and water. Cover and bring it to a vigorous boil. Once the water starts to boil, reduce the heat to low and cook it for about 30 minutes.

After 30 minutes, uncover and check to see if the rice and lentils are cooked (it should be cooked by now, if its not, cover and cook it for a bit longer). Now continue cooking UNCOVER for another 1 to 2 minutes on low heat to get rid of any excess moisture. Turn off the heat.

Garnish with parsley, lemon juice, ground black pepper and drizzle of olive oil. Give it a gentle mix because the rice is very delicate at this point and we don't want to break it . Cover and let it sit for another 5 minutes before serving (for the flavors to blend).
