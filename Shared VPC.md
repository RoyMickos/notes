In google, a shared vpc is not, in fact, a networking construct but a IAM policy consturct. You take one GCP *project* and assign it as the host project, then you can set other *projects* as service projects. You can then allow service projects to use the networks of the host project. Using projects in this way helps with least priviledge, as the networking expertice can be allocated to the host while services focus on their application.
The other way of managing this is *VPC peering*, where separately managed networks agree to peer with each other. However, if these networks belong to projects in the same organisation, then organisation policy service can be used to restrict which each project can or cannot do. Peering is the basis of *hub-and-spoke* architecture.
